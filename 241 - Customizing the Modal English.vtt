Instructor: The next thing we're going to work on

00:02.220 --> 00:04.680
is allowing the parent component of modal page

00:04.680 --> 00:07.830
to better customize the content displayed inside the modal.

00:07.830 --> 00:08.970
So, inside of our modal window,

00:08.970 --> 00:11.520
we might have some content up here at the top

00:11.520 --> 00:14.190
with some information we want to provide to the user,

00:14.190 --> 00:15.930
and then down towards the bottom,

00:15.930 --> 00:17.340
we might have a series of different buttons

00:17.340 --> 00:18.990
the user can click on to maybe say

00:18.990 --> 00:21.510
that they accept something, they decline something,

00:21.510 --> 00:23.670
a cancel button, and so on.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.800
The modal component isn't really going to know

00:25.800 --> 00:27.780
what components need to be shown.

00:27.780 --> 00:30.300
So, we're going to allow the modal page to customize

00:30.300 --> 00:33.240
both of these different areas independently.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.130
To customize the content at the top right here,

00:35.130 --> 00:36.630
we're gonna have our modal page

00:36.630 --> 00:39.120
pass down a prop called children.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.850
And then, to customize the content at the bottom,

00:41.850 --> 00:44.460
we're gonna pass it onto a prop called actionBar.

00:44.460 --> 00:47.580
It's called actionBar because this is kind of a bar of area

00:47.580 --> 00:49.680
where a user is going to commit some action

00:49.680 --> 00:52.950
like clicking on a button or something like that.

00:52.950 --> 00:54.690
So inside of our modal page component,

00:54.690 --> 00:56.700
we're gonna pass down these two props.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.750
And then inside the modal,

00:57.750 --> 01:00.990
we just need to make sure we show those on the screen.

01:00.990 --> 01:03.360
Both these props are gonna be something renderable

01:03.360 --> 01:07.653
so a string, a number, a react component, JSX, so on.

01:09.930 --> 01:13.083
Okay, so to get started inside of modal page dot js,

01:13.980 --> 01:16.580
I'm gonna find where we create our modal right here.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.400
We're gonna have to add in a good amount of props to this.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.010
So to just make my code a little bit more legible,

01:23.010 --> 01:26.103
I'm going to extract that modal component right there.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.713
So I'm gonna cut it and then define modal up here, like so.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.700
Then at the show modal and, I'll put in reference

01:35.700 --> 01:37.150
that variable I just created.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.050
So I only did this just to give myself a little bit

01:40.050 --> 01:41.130
more space to work with

01:41.130 --> 01:44.073
so I can more easily pass in some props to this component.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.490
To pass in the children prop,

01:47.490 --> 01:50.730
I'm going to delete the closing forward slash right there.

01:50.730 --> 01:52.420
I'm going to delete the semicolon

01:53.280 --> 01:56.103
and then put in a closing modal like so.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.500
Now inside of here, I could add in

01:58.500 --> 02:00.637
maybe a paragraph element and say,

02:00.637 --> 02:04.737
"here is an important agreement for you to accept."

02:05.640 --> 02:07.740
So this is my children prop.

02:07.740 --> 02:09.270
We need to receive it inside the modal

02:09.270 --> 02:11.523
and display it inside of the modal window.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.650
I then want to add in some actionBar, some kind of button

02:16.650 --> 02:19.260
or something like that that the user can click on.

02:19.260 --> 02:22.713
So I'm also gonna put in an actionBar prop right here.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.860
And this is going to have a string, a number,

02:25.860 --> 02:28.380
or some JSX that we're gonna show at the bottom

02:28.380 --> 02:29.553
of that white window.

02:30.660 --> 02:32.040
So I'll put in for right now.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.083
How about another button element?

02:37.770 --> 02:40.707
I'll give this the text of "I accept."

02:41.730 --> 02:43.173
And how about primary?

02:45.060 --> 02:47.190
Now right away, this is getting kind of hard to read

02:47.190 --> 02:48.960
with this really long prop right here.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.390
So I think maybe we should also extract this

02:51.390 --> 02:53.310
into a separate variable.

02:53.310 --> 02:56.050
So I'm gonna take that button right there, cut it

02:57.000 --> 02:58.710
and then right above our modal variable,

02:58.710 --> 03:01.890
I'll create a new variable called actionBar.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.680
And I'll have this be a div

03:04.680 --> 03:07.230
that shows the button inside of it.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.630
And then I can use this actionBar variable,

03:09.630 --> 03:12.153
pass it off to the actionBar prop.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.670
Okay, let's save this right now.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.200
We'll then go into our modal component.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.280
We're gonna make sure that we make use

03:20.280 --> 03:23.850
of the children prop and the actionBar prop.

03:23.850 --> 03:26.040
So inside of modal.js,

03:26.040 --> 03:30.183
I will receive children and actionBar.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.900
Then inside the div with the class name

03:33.900 --> 03:37.650
of "absolute inset 40", I'm going to delete the text

03:37.650 --> 03:41.310
of "I'm a Modal" and replace it

03:41.310 --> 03:44.913
with Children and actionBar.

03:46.530 --> 03:47.940
Now, in just a little bit, we're gonna add in

03:47.940 --> 03:49.740
some more elements and styling inside of here

03:49.740 --> 03:52.890
to provide more separation between children and actionBar.

03:52.890 --> 03:54.510
So right now it might seem a little bit pointless

03:54.510 --> 03:56.100
to have these two separate props.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.493
Don't worry. We're gonna address that in a little bit.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.950
Alright, so let's save with these files back over

04:01.950 --> 04:02.783
inside the browser.

04:02.783 --> 04:04.260
I can now open the modal

04:04.260 --> 04:05.910
and I'll see here's an important agreement

04:05.910 --> 04:08.410
for you to accept. And then the "I accept" button.

04:09.270 --> 04:10.590
Okay, so that definitely looks good.

04:10.590 --> 04:12.180
Off to a good start.

04:12.180 --> 04:14.400
Right now if I click on the "I accept" button,

04:14.400 --> 04:15.540
nothing happens.

04:15.540 --> 04:18.510
We probably want to make sure that the modal gets closed.

04:18.510 --> 04:21.393
So to do so, back inside of modal page.

04:23.310 --> 04:24.900
Here's modal page.

04:24.900 --> 04:28.260
Here's where we create that button that says "I accept".

04:28.260 --> 04:30.180
So to make sure that whenever user clicks on this thing,

04:30.180 --> 04:31.380
we close the modal,

04:31.380 --> 04:34.140
we can add on a click event handler to this

04:34.140 --> 04:37.053
that's going to update the show modal piece of state.

04:38.910 --> 04:41.040
In fact, we already have a click event handler

04:41.040 --> 04:43.770
that does exactly that called handle Close.

04:43.770 --> 04:46.680
So let's just pass that off to the button element.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.577
So I'll put in an "on click handle close".

04:53.670 --> 04:54.820
Alright, one more save.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.867
Now if I refresh open the modal, I can click on

04:58.867 --> 05:00.663
"I accept" and it goes away.

05:01.980 --> 05:02.813
Looks good.
